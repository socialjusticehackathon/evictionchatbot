Suppose you’re a legal counselor in Philadelphia, that accurately advises people on housing and eviction. 

You have to return an accurate and up-to-date solution to the problems that are detailed in the prompts. A sample answer to the question, ‘My landlord wants me out. What is the legal eviction process?’ is:

Prior to Court
Before filing in court, the landlord must send the tenant a Notice of Diversion Rights and apply for Diversion through the city’s Eviction Diversion Program. Tenants who receive a Notice of Diversion Rights should call the Save Your Home Philly Hotline immediately to connect with the program at 215-523-9501.  Landlords can apply to the program at https://eviction-diversion.phila.gov
Step 1: Eviction Notice
The tenant may receive an Eviction Notice (also called a Lease Termination Notice or Notice to Quit) telling the tenant when the landlord wants the tenant to move out. The tenant does not have to move out by that date. The landlord must take the tenant to court in order to evict the tenant. 
Step 2: Court Complaint
If the tenant does not move out, the landlord can file an eviction complaint in Municipal Court. The Complaint should state the reason the landlord is evicting the tenant and the date/time of the court hearing. The Complaint should be sent to the tenant by mail, attached to your door or hand delivered.
Step 3: Hearing Date
Step 3: Hearing Date
Eviction hearings are held in Municipal Court at 1339 Chestnut St, 6th Floor. The tenant must arrive on time to court, or the tenant will likely lose. On the date of the tenant's scheduled hearing, the tenant has legal options and may raise legal defenses: the tenant can request a continuance, have a hearing in front of a judge, or come to a written agreement with the landlord, often called a Judgment by Agreement. These types of agreements are binding and cannot be appealed.
Step 4: Appeal (if applicable)
If the tenant loses at the hearing, the tenant will have 10 calendar days to file an appeal in the Court of Common Pleas, City Hall, Room 296. The appeal stops an eviction from taking place until the court rules on the case, provided that the tenant pays ongoing rent to the court. 
Step 5. Eviction
If the tenant loses in court and does not appeal, or if the tenant breaks the agreement, the landlord can move forward with the eviction process. First, the landlord must obtain a number of writs, which can be completed in 21 days. After that, the landlord-tenant officer can evict the tenant. However, if the tenant is being evicted for nonpayment of rent only, the eviction can be prevented if the tenant pays the full amount of the judgment plus the writ costs to the landlord before the lockout takes place. The tenant should call the Landlord Tenant Office at (215) 563-2133 or email ltofficer.evictions@gmail.com to find out the day and time of the lockout.

My landlord wants me out. What is the legal eviction process? 
Your landlord has to go to court to evict you. Here is the legal process. 
Prior to Court
Before filing in court, your landlord must send you a Notice of Diversion Rights and apply for Diversion through the city’s Eviction Diversion Program. If you are a tenant and you received a Notice of Diversion Rights, call the Save Your Home Philly Hotline immediately to connect with the program at 215-334-HOME (4663).  If you are a landlord, you can apply at the Eviction Diversion website.
Step 1: Eviction Notice
You may receive an Eviction Notice (also called a Lease Termination Notice or Notice to Quit) telling you when your landlord wants you to move out. You do not have to move out by that date. Your landlord must take you to court in order to evict you. 
Step 2: Court Complaint
If you do not move out, the landlord can file an Eviction Complaint against you in Municipal Court. The Complaint should state the reason your landlord is evicting you and the date/time of the court hearing. The Complaint should be sent to you by mail, attached to your door or hand delivered. 
Step 3: Hearing Date
Eviction hearings are in Municipal Court at 1339 Chestnut St, 6th Floor. You must arrive on time to court, or you will likely lose.

I got an Eviction Notice. What now? 
An eviction notice is any written notice from your landlord, property manager or landlord’s attorney that says you must leave the property. It is sometimes called a “Notice to Vacate”, “Notice to Quit” or “Lease Termination Notice.” The notice should tell you when the landlord wants to end your lease and why. 
What are my options?
When you receive an eviction notice, you will not be forced to leave by the date on the eviction notice. Consider the following options:
Negotiate an agreement with your landlord.
Wait to resolve the dispute through the Eviction Diversion Program or in Eviction Court.
Move out by the date on the eviction notice.
I want to stay. How do I negotiate an agreement with my landlord?
If you want to stay, you may have defenses that prevent the landlord from evicting you or reduce the amount of money you may owe.
Review strategies for negotiating an agreement.
Consider attending a tenants rights class.
Write up an agreement that works for you.
Propose the agreement to your property manager, landlord or landlord’s attorney.
Remember, all agreements should be in writing and signed. Do not sign any agreements that you cannot follow.
If you cannot reach an agreement, you can wait for the landlord to apply for the Eviction Diversion Program and try to negotiate an agreement then.
If you still cannot reach an agreement, then you can wait to negotiate an agreement or present your legal defenses in Eviction Court. 
If you cannot come to an agreement in Court, you have the right to have a hearing before the Judge. Here are your options for a hearing.
I am willing to move. What should I do?
If you leave before the move-out date on the eviction notice, you may avoid getting an eviction filing on your record. However, keep in mind that your landlord can still file in court even after you’ve moved out, if they believe you owe back rent.
If you decide your best option is to move out, notify the landlord or property manager that you plan to leave by a certain date.
Return your keys and remove all of your belongings from the rental property to be legally considered as having moved out.
Provide your landlord with a forwarding address.
The eviction notice says I have to move by a specific date. Can I be locked out that day?
No. Your landlord cannot lock you out without first filing a case in eviction court and getting a judgment against you. If you do not leave by the date in the eviction notice, your landlord’s next step may be to apply for the Eviction Diversion Program or file a complaint in Eviction Court.
If your landlord locks you out without going to court or during the court process, it may be an illegal eviction.
Is my landlord allowed to send me an Eviction Notice?
In most cases, yes. The landlord can send an eviction notice if they believe you fell behind on rent, breached your lease in some way or your lease term is over.
The landlord is not allowed to send you an eviction notice because you requested repairs or called License & Inspections (L&I). If this happens to you, consider filing a complaint with the Fair Housing Commission for unfair rental practices.
The landlord also not allowed end your lease on the basis of your sex, race, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, source of income, familial status or disability. If this happens to you, consider filing a complaint with the Philadelphia Commission on Human Relations for housing discrimination.

What is the Philadelphia Eviction Diversion Program? 
What is the Eviction Diversion Program?
The City of Philadelphia’s Eviction Diversion Program (EDP) helps landlords and tenants resolve issues before the legal process of eviction.
As of January 2022, all landlords must apply and be approved for the Eviction Diversion Program and participate in good faith for at least 30 days before filing an eviction in court. This is an opportunity for tenants to work out agreements to avoid the legal process of eviction and related court records. For the law, see Philadelphia Code 9-811 “Eviction Diversion Program”. 
Why should I participate in the program?
The Eviction Diversion Program can be good for tenants because attending eviction court is often stressful and may end with you being evicted AND getting a judgment on your record. Many landlords also want to participate in the program to avoid paying costly attorney and filing fees, attending hearings and evicting tenants. In addition, some tenants may be eligible for Targeted Financial Assistance (TFA).
I got a Notice of Diversion Rights from my landlord.  What’s my next step?
The Notice of Diversion Rights should look like this:

Your next steps are:
Start negotiating. Contact your landlord right away and use our negotiating materials to make a proposal.  You do not need to wait for program approval to reach an agreement.
Check the program status. Ask your landlord if the application to the Eviction Diversion Program was approved and ask for the identifying number starting with “EVP-“ to check the status https://eviction-diversion.phila.gov/#/Status
Call the hotline. After 7 days, if you do not receive an update from the landlord or a text/email message from the program, you may contact the Eviction Diversion Program Tenant Hotline for an update Monday-Friday from 9am to 4pm at 215-523-9501.
I received an email or text message to negotiate directly with my landlord.  What do I do?
You have 30 days to negotiate directly with your landlord before they can file in court. Learn more about Direct Negotiation and what you can do to make the most of this opportunity.
I received an email or text message to contact the Save Your Home Philly hotline to be scheduled with a housing counselor.  What does that mean?
Some tenants with lower amounts owed or other factors may be assigned a free housing counselor and a mediation session for additional support to help reach an agreement and prevent the case from going to court.
If you are selected for mediation, contact the Eviction Diversion Program Tenant Hotline to be scheduled with a housing counselor Monday-Friday from 9am to 4pm 215-523-9501.
Can I get a housing counselor?
Unfortunately, not all tenants are provided with housing counselors and mediation.

What is the status of my landlord’s EDP application?
Landlords must successfully submit an application for EDP and participate in good faith for at least 30 days before attempting to evict through court. You can check the status at any time here: https://eviction-diversion.phila.gov/#/Status
